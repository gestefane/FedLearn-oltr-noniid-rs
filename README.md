The official repository for [Is Non-IID Data a Threat in Federated Online Learning to Rank?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09272.pdf), *SIGIR2022*

Here are few steps to reproduce our experiments.

## Setup python environment
Create a conda environment for running this code using the code below.

````
conda create --name federated python=3.6
source activate federated
# assuming you want to checkout the repo in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/ielab/2022-SIGIR-noniid-foltr.git && cd 2022-SIGIR-noniid-foltr
pip install -r requirements.txt 
````

## Reproducing results
To reproduce our experiments result, set up corresponding parameters and run files: `./runs/run_fpdgd_non_iid_linear.py` `./runs/run_fpdgd_non_iid_neural.py`
```
python run_fpdgd_non_iid_linear.py
```
```
python run_fpdgd_non_iid_neural.py
```
or run files: `./scripts/run_fpdgd_noniid_linear.sh` `./scripts/run_fpdgd_noniid_neural.sh`
```
sh run_fpdgd_noniid_linear.sh
```
```
